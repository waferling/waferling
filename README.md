## Hi there 👋

I'm Wafa, a software engineer based in the UAE.

At the moment, I'm studying Computer Science with a focus on full-stack development.

I'm always looking to learn something- be it a framework like React, or how to create a cool feature for an app or website.

On the side, I love game development, pixel art, and platformers.


## Tools & Tech

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* C, Python, React
* SQL, TailwindCSS

## A Bit about Me

* :notebook_with_decorative_cover: I'm a quick reader
* :tshirt: I can sew using a machine
* :video_game: Video games are always interesting to me
* :gear: I like building things that are sleek, elegant, and useful
